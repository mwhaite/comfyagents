# AI Workflow GUI Project Specification

## Overview

The AI Workflow GUI project aims to provide a visual interface for creating and managing AI agent workflows. The interface will be accessible through a web browser by connecting to port 4000. It will feature a node-based structure similar to ComfyUI, allowing users to visually construct workflows by connecting different nodes, each representing a specific task or function in the AI agent's workflow. The project's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will demonstrate this capability with a set of predefined nodes. The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for the easy addition of new nodes and functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Dependencies Installation**: The project relies on several non-standard dependencies, including:
   - `Node.js` and `npm` for the backend server and managing JavaScript dependencies.
   - `Express` for creating the server.
   - `Socket.IO` for real-time communication between the client and server.
   - `Vue.js` for the frontend framework, chosen for its reactivity and component-based architecture.
   - `D3.js` for rendering the node-based GUI, due to its powerful data visualization capabilities.

2. **Server Setup**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - Start the server by running `npm start`. The server will listen on port 4000.

3. **Accessing the GUI**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to access the GUI.

## Architecture

### Core Classes and Functions

- `Server.js`: Initializes the Express server and sets up Socket.IO for real-time communication.
- `WorkflowManager.js`: Manages the creation, execution, and management of workflows. It interacts with individual nodes and orchestrates their execution.
- `Node.js`: Abstract base class for all nodes. Each node type will extend this class. It defines common properties and methods that all nodes must have.
   - `execute()`: Method that executes the node's logic.
   - `configure()`: Method for setting up node-specific configurations.
- `NodeFactory.js`: Responsible for creating instances of nodes based on type. It uses the Factory Design Pattern to simplify node creation.
- `GUIManager.js`: Handles the rendering and interaction logic of the GUI using Vue.js and D3.js. It communicates with the `WorkflowManager` to reflect changes in the workflow.

### Component Functionality

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a specific task in the AI workflow, such as data input, processing, decision making, etc. Nodes are self-contained, with their logic and definition stored in individual files. This modular design facilitates the addition of new node types.
- **Workflow Management**: Users can create, modify, and execute workflows by visually connecting nodes in the GUI. The `WorkflowManager` class orchestrates the execution of these workflows, ensuring that data flows correctly between nodes.
- **Real-time Updates**: The GUI updates in real-time to reflect changes in the workflow's execution state, thanks to Socket.IO integration. This provides immediate feedback to the user.
