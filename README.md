# Project Specification Document

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based GUI, inspired by comfyui, for the creation and management of AI agent workflows. The GUI will be accessible via a web browser on port 4000. The interface will utilize a node-based structure to represent and manipulate the components of AI workflows. Each node will encapsulate specific logic and definitions, facilitating a modular and extensible design. Comprehensive documentation will be provided to ensure ease of future development and maintenance.

## Core Features

1. **Web Server**: A web server to serve the GUI on port 4000.
2. **Node-based GUI**: A graphical interface that allows users to create, edit, and manage AI agent workflows through a node-based structure.
3. **Node Customization**: Users can define and customize nodes, including their logic and interconnections.
4. **Workflow Management**: Tools for saving, loading, and executing AI workflows.
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation covering the GUI's use, the project's architecture, and the codebase.

## Technical Specifications

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **WebServer**
   - Purpose: To initialize and run the web server, serving the GUI on port 4000.
   - Methods:
     - `start()`: Starts the server.
     - `stop()`: Stops the server.

2. **Node**
   - Purpose: Base class for all nodes, encapsulating common properties and methods.
   - Methods:
     - `execute()`: Executes the node's logic.
     - `connect(otherNode)`: Connects this node to another node.
     - `serialize()`: Serializes the node for saving/loading workflows.

3. **NodeFactory**
   - Purpose: To create instances of nodes from definitions.
   - Methods:
     - `createNode(type, options)`: Creates and returns a node of the specified type with the given options.

4. **WorkflowManager**
   - Purpose: To manage the creation, execution, and persistence of workflows.
   - Methods:
     - `createWorkflow()`: Creates a new workflow.
     - `loadWorkflow(id)`: Loads a workflow by ID.
     - `saveWorkflow(workflow)`: Saves the given workflow.
     - `executeWorkflow(workflow)`: Executes the given workflow.

5. **GUIRenderer**
   - Purpose: To render the node-based GUI in the web browser.
   - Methods:
     - `renderNode(node)`: Renders a node in the GUI.
     - `connectNodes(node1, node2)`: Renders a connection between two nodes.

### Non-standard Dependencies

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to serve the web GUI.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and the server.
- **D3.js** or **vis.js**: For rendering the node-based GUI.
- **body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers.
- **uuid**: For generating unique IDs for workflows and nodes.

### Documentation

1. **User Guide**: A comprehensive guide detailing how to use the GUI for creating and managing AI workflows.
2. **Developer Guide**: Documentation covering the project's architecture, setup, and how to extend the GUI with new nodes.
3. **Code Documentation**: Inline comments and docstrings explaining the purpose and usage of classes, methods, and significant blocks of code.

### Development Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each node is a self-contained file, allowing for easy addition, removal, or modification of nodes.
- **Scalability**: The server and GUI design should accommodate an increasing number of users and nodes.
- **Security**: Implement security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a powerful and user-friendly GUI for AI agent workflow creation and management, leveraging a modular node-based architecture. Through comprehensive documentation and a focus on extensibility, this project lays the groundwork for future development and expansion.
