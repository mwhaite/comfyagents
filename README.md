Given the specifications, we'll start with the development of the frontend environment setup and the basic GUI resembling comfyui. This involves creating several files: `index.html`, `index.js`, `setupFrontendEnvironment.js`, and `run.sh`. Additionally, a `package.json` file will be necessary to manage Node.js project dependencies.

Let's begin with the `index.html` file, which is the entry point for our GUI.
