# Specification for `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` and `run.sh`

This document outlines the requirements and structure for the `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` script and the `run.sh` shell script. The primary goal of these scripts is to automate the setup process for the frontend environment of a web-based GUI application, ensuring that the directory structure is correct, necessary directories are created if missing, and permissions are verified. Additionally, `run.sh` will check for Node.js installation and handle dependency installation.

## Overview

This specification outlines the requirements and structure for the `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` script and the `run.sh` shell script. The primary goal of these scripts is to automate the setup process for the frontend environment of a web-based GUI application, ensuring that the directory structure is correct, necessary directories are created if missing, and permissions are verified. Additionally, `run.sh` will check for Node.js installation and handle dependency installation.

## `setupFrontendEnvironment.js`

### Purpose

Automates the verification of the project's directory structure, creates necessary directories if they don't exist, and checks for correct permissions.

### Core Functions

1. `verifyDirectoryStructure()`: Checks if the required directories exist within the project structure.
2. `createDirectory(directoryPath)`: Creates a directory at the specified path if it does not exist.
3. `checkPermissions(directoryPath)`: Verifies that the directory has the correct permissions, adjusting if necessary.
4. `main()`: The entry point of the script that orchestrates the verification, creation, and permission checking processes.

### Dependencies

- `fs` (Node.js built-in module): Used for file system operations such as checking for directory existence and creating directories.
- `path` (Node.js built-in module): Used for handling and transforming file paths.

## `run.sh`

### Purpose

Ensures that Node.js is installed, runs `setupFrontendEnvironment.js`, and installs project dependencies via `npm install`.

### Core Commands

1. Check for Node.js installation: `if ! command -v node &> /dev/null; then echo "Node.js is not installed. Please install Node.js."; exit 1; fi`
2. Execute `setupFrontendEnvironment.js`: `node setupFrontendEnvironment.js`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Dependencies

- Node.js: The runtime environment required to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- npm: Node.js package manager used for installing project dependencies.

## Directory Structure Verification and Creation

The `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` script will ensure the following directory structure is present:

```
project-root/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── public/
│   ├── images/
│   └── index.html
└── scripts/
```

If any of these directories do not exist, the script will create them and set appropriate permissions (read, write, and execute for the user; read and execute for the group and others).

## Execution Flow

The following steps outline the execution flow of the `run.sh` script:

1. The user executes `run.sh`.
2. `run.sh` checks for Node.js and npm installations.
3. `run.sh` executes `setupFrontendEnvironment.js`.
4. `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` verifies the directory structure, creates missing directories, and checks/sets permissions.
5. `run.sh` runs `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Notes

- The `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` script should include error handling for all file system operations to ensure robustness.
- Logging should be implemented in `setupFrontendEnvironment.js` to inform the user about the operations being performed and their outcomes.
- `run.sh` should have execute permissions set by running `chmod +x run.sh` before it can be executed.
